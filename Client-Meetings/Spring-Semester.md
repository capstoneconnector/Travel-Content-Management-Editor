## January Meeting
* Discussed issues with connecting with the database
* We were using .NetCORE not .Net. Kyle has experience with .Net ans understands it more as .NetCore is newer. We may scrap repo and start over on .Net.
* Goal to pull and push data. 

## February Meeting
* Every place tied to an organization - highest level of organization
* TOUR as a prefix for organization
* User associtaed to one or more organizations - places associated with organization, then tour. 
* All ID's generated. 
* Summary override - change based on default location or as an event/tour
* GeoJSON as a tour path
* Make Person table with Name and GUID to assign that GUID to an organization GUID
