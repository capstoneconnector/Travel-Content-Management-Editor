# Travel Content Management Editor
Erin Loehr, Ben Rose, Mike Bastian

The company 14Eleven Development seeks to build a web-based travel content management solution to provide their business-to-business (B2B) 
clients an efficient platform to edit, showcase, and organize their content. Travelers from all over the world visit towns and cities they may 
know little about, and they want to experience all the local activities, places, and events during their stay. Our B2B clients require a 
toolset to integrate and/or sync data from external systems or sources; to build and create complex tours for travelers to follow and track on 
a mobile device; and to maintain their data, including text and media assets.
