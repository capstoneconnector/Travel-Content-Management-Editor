# October Meetings  

### 10/3/2018  
We met at 10am in the library to discuss the requirements document due and a restructuring of the GitHub repository. Created and shared 
two documents (google sheets and google docs) for the requirements assignment and formatted both before beginning to work on them. 

### 10/12/2018
We met at 10am in the library to discuss the upcoming client meeting the following Monday. Assumed that this meeting would include the
discussion of specific design details/prototypes.  
  * Is the map view the most important?
  * Drawing the tour on the map vs choosing locations on the tour and having the website generate the best path?
  * View of existing data - tabs, filter system, etc?
  * When should the clients' outside data be imported? Do they schedule it? Automatically? Nightly?
  * Any limits on adding data? Number or points of interest? Locations involved in an event? Length of a tour?
  * After end date for events and tours, should they automatically delete? Delete with warning of deletion? 
  * Have the ability to set whether a tour is public or private? Set time and date for tour to go public? Applicable to events and points of
  interest.
  * Automatically calculate latitude and longitude?
  * How are the identifiers generated?
  
Discussed the database schema and what it entails along with the suggestion of each member creating their own prototype version and discussing the differences and similarites before bringing them to the meeting.  

### 10/19/18
We met at 10am in the library to discuss the colloquium (that Ben attended on behalf of the group). We also discussed the midterm and worked on the uml assignment due. We drew a rough sketch of the uml diagram on paper and divided work. 

### 10/27/18
We met at 10am in the library to touch base this week. With the test being this week we didn't end up making much progress. We also met with our client earlier than other groups so we were trying to go over our notes and see what we want to share with the class when presentation time comes. Our next step may just be drawing some prototyppes of what we may want our webpage to look like.

### 10/31/18
We met at 10am in the library to work on Thursday's presentation. We went over the requirements and divided work while discussing each of the questions listed on the presentation guidelines.
