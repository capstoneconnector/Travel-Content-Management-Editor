# Deployment Document
- Deployment through azure was very simple
- It was done at the click of a button since we are connected to the Azure server
- To access the site just follow this link: https://travel-content-management-editor20190424050040.azurewebsites.net/
- The azure server maintains applications pretty well but it is not exactly free
- Deployment is all through azure so if trouble shooting is needed azure would be the wisest place to start trouble shooting
- To start the system just follow the link, to stop the system just close the tab
- The app deploys with both a desktop and decent mobile view, but it was designed for desktop
