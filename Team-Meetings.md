# Team Meetings

  week in order to meet with the client. Emailed the client asking about availability for the following week.
  
## 9/18/18
  Discussed the upcoming meeting with the client including potential questions:  
  * Clarification on the users of the system. Business-to-Business but it seems like the clients of the business also can view the
  information. Does this website connect to the existing app?
  * Will an API for Google Maps need to be used?
  * Business log-in to access data?
  * Specific external systems and sources or general? Are these sources all in the same format and file type, or does the software
  need to accomodate many types?
  * "Texts and media assests?"
