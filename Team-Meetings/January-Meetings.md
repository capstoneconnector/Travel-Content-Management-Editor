# Meeting 1
 ..* We met on January 10th for the first time this semester in the library
 ..* We each tried to learn some new information for the portion of the project each of us will be working on
 ..* As it seems with many other teams we had higher hopes for what we could get done over break compared to what we really did
 ..* We also had some github issues we ended up having to straighten out over break.
 ..* We plan to meet pretty often to get a working prototype for iteration number 1 we also planned to touch base with our clieant Kyle parker in the near future
