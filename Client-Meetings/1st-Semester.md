### Second Meeting: 10/15/18
1. Schema Information  
Updated by Tours/Events, not visible but still stored after Date  
No automation done by us  
No data Deleted  
2. Tour Details  
Flags that identify users who can see certain Tours/Events  
Talked about collaborators, but will come back to in later meetings
3. Manually entering information
Search capabilities  
Usually grabbed by google maps(Long/Lat) what we will use  
No limits on tours or events available for creation  
4. Marker creation
Like google in style  
Markers should be stitched together after marker information is provided  
Possibly customer preplans KML file on google (pre set tour)  
Import KML file that we convert to fit application style
5. Visual  
More content view than map, but both are accessible  
A lot is based on previous tours and events, having that access as well as map and tour creation visible   
Customer if having created a tour before, has generic information populated to entry, a lot of times information by customer   is reused(pictures)  
6. Avoid using PathPoint**  
KML import would convert to a geo json file for mapping
