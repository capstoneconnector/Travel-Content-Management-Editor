# Meeting 1
 1. We met on January 10th for the first time this semester in the library
 2. We each tried to learn some new information for the portion of the project each of us will be working on
 3. As it seems with many other teams we had higher hopes for what we could get done over break compared to what we really did
 4. We also had some github issues we ended up having to straighten out over break.
 5. We plan to meet pretty often to get a working prototype for iteration number 1 we also planned to touch base with our clieant Kyle parker in the near future
